# Week 6, Day 1: Moar Reddit

## Description

What's Reddit without a thriving community of miscreants? Let's add comments! What could possibly go wrong?

### Learning Objectives

* Nested routes/resources
* Refactoring
* More heroku deployments

## Details

### Deliverables

* [An issue in the class repo](https://github.com/tiy-indianapolis-ror-june2015/assignments/issues) titled `Week 6, Day 1 - moar reddit - <YOUR_NAME>`.
* A closed pull request (from `moar` to `master`) containing today's work
* A comment on that issue when you're done that has the link to the _updated_ (not new) app on heroku and a link to the aforementioned pull request
* Said issue closed and assigned to me @dummied

### Requirements

#### Normal Mode

* In the course of the afternoon, I'll be making code comments/issues in your weekend lab repository. Fix those. Ideally, close those issues using your git commit message.
* If you haven't completed _everything_ in the weekend Reddit lab, keep working on it.
* If something in today's lecture seemed like a better idea than what you had done, refactor your code to improve it.

#### Hard Mode

* Add comments to links. They should belong to a user and require a user to create one.
* Show the comments, but not the form, to non-logged-in users.
* Make it so there's a link to specific comment (for sharing/shaming)

#### Nightmare Mode

* The above should use nested resources and routes
* Comments should be _threaded_ (as in: you can comment on a comment on a comment ... etc.)
* Comments should also display as threaded
