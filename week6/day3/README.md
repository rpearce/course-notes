# Week 6, Day 3

The first part of today's lecture involved APIs and a bit about consuming them.

This was mostly foreshadowing for next week (and a _lot_ of Week 8). In the meantime, I'd suggest walkign through a few of the [codecademy API courses](https://www.codecademy.com/apis), specifically the Ruby and/or Javascript-based ones.

The back half we talked more about bootstrap and the asset pipeline.

Code for today is the same old `redditer` folder from Day 1 of this week (plus the tiny API scraper script in this folder).
