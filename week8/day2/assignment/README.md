# Week 8, Day 2: Testing.

## Description

As we learned in lecture today (hopefully), file uploading and image handling can be a bit ... tricky ... especially when dealing with AJAX-based applications.

So, let's give it a whirl.

## Objectives

* Testing in Rails
* Working in existing projects
* Refactoring

## Deliverables

* A pull request to your Week 7 Lab repo from branch `testing` to `master`
* [An issue in the class repo](https://github.com/tiy-indianapolis-ror-june2015/assignments/issues) titled `Week 8, Day 2 - Testing - <YOUR_NAME>`
* A comment on your original Issue with a link to your live, updated Heroku app and the aforementioned PR
* Said issue assigned to me, @dummied

## Requirements

### Normal Mode

* During the afternoon, I'll be making comments/issues against your weekend lab. Fix said issues.
* If you haven't completed all the modes of the past two assignments (Week 8, Day 1 and the Week 7 Lab), keep working on them.
* Add tests for your models using `shoulda`

### Hard Mode

* Refactor your controllers to move methods into the models.
* Make sure you have tests for them.
* Get `capybara` and `poltergeist` installed.

### Nightmare Mode

* Write an integration test, ideally for sign up, login and/or logout
