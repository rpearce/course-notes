## Description

Let's finish up and polish up our weekend lab.

## Deliverables

* A mess of pull requests to finish and polish up your team Week 8 Lab
* [An issue in the class repo](https://github.com/tiy-indianapolis-ror-june2015/assignments/issues) titled `Week 9, Day 1 - Wonder Woman - <YOUR_NAME>`
* A comment on your original Issue with a link to your live, updated Heroku app and the pull requests you made to the app today.
* Said issue assigned to me, @dummied

## Requirements

### Normal Mode

* The same as the weekend lab. Finish it up.
* I might also make issues against the lab. If I do, fix those.

### Hard Mode

* Mail a receipt to the person after purchase. Use SendGrid to send the email on heroku.
* If you're changing your cart logic, I'd suggest you write some tests first to ensure everything still works afterward

### Nightmare mode

* If a cart has items in it, but hasn't been purchased within 24 hours, send an email reminder to the user that they have an unfinished cart waiting on them.
