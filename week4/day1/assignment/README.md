# Surf-n-Paddle on Sinatra

## Description

Hey, let's make our Surf-n-Paddle site dynamic and get it running off Sinatra.

## Learning objectives

* Get a Sinatra app up and running
* Learn about `erb` templates

## Details

### Deliverables

* [An issue in the class repo](https://github.com/tiy-indianapolis-ror-june2015/assignments/issues) titled `4.1 - SnP Sinatra -- YOUR NAME`.
* If you haven't already, merge your dev branch from the weekend Lab into master.
* A branch on your _existing_ Surf-n-Paddle repo called 'sinatra'
* A Pull Request (PR) in your _existing_ Surf-n-Paddle repo:
  * _from_ branch `sinatra`
  * _into_ branch master
* A comment on your original Issue with a link to your PR

### Requirements

* Your index file from the Lab should now be an `erb` template.
* At _least_ one area of that template should be dynamic data generated on the server via Sinatra
* All of your static assets (images, styles, etc.) should also be served via Sinatra.

### Hard mode

* Make a second version of your page with different dynamic values
* Make a version of your page that changes those dynamic values via a URL parameter

### Nightmare mode

* Use a layout for the above.
