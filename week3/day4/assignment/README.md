## Normal Mode

Using the image located `assets/surf-and-paddle.png`, create a html document using html and css to look like below, but be a functional website:

![Surf and paddle image](assets/surf-and-paddle.png)

**Notes:** Your goal is not to recreate the exact look, but rather the structure and elements. Choose your own images, fonts (although, if you can match, that'd be aces) and even text if that floats yer boat.

Have fun with it.

... and remember: Think in terms of _boxes_.
