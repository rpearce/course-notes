# First Website

## Description
The ability to transform thoughts and images in to a visual medium is necessary for your success as a developer. If your skillset only fills a piece of the puzzle (e.g., you only like to do "backend" work), then you are less valuable than someone who can accomplish the tasks of the full stack, and it will be difficult to survive on your own.

This assignment provides an image and will require you to create the
equivalent visual in HTML & CSS.
